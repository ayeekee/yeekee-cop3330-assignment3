// General Steps
    // create file using the path of the input file
    // create string variable for the word we're looking for
    // create int variable to store how many times the word appears
    // while loop to read through the whole file
        // use reader to read through word by word
            // use " " as the delimiter
        // if the match is found, update count variable
        // continue until end of file
    // do this for all three words, store values in three different int variables
    // store them in a hashmap and sort from greatest to least
    // print the words we were looking for
        // using a for loop and the int variables of the value of the hashmap, print stars of histogram

// Main function
    // create three int variables of the words we're looking for to store the result from frequencyFinder function call
        // set the variable equal to the function call three times
    // store values as values in a hashmap, use the words as keys
    // create new map variable to store the sorted values and keys in
    // sort in descending order to print from greatest to least
    // for the sorted map,
        // store value in a variable to use for loop to print stars
        // print key
        // use a for loop and value variable to print out stars of histogram

// frequencyFinder function
    // take in the word we are looking for
    // create file from path of input file "src/main/java/ex46/exercise46_input.txt"
    // use FileReader and BufferedReader to read info from file
    // create int variable count to keep track of how many times the word appears
    // while line is not null,
        // read in each word separated by a line
        // look for match
        // if the match is found using .equals, update count variable
        // continue until end of file
    // return count variable
