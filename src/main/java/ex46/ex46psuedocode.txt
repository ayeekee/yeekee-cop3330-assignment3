// General Steps
    // create file using the path of the input file
    // create string variable for the word we're looking for
    // create int variable to store how many times the word appears
    // while loop to read through the whole file
        // use reader to read through word by word
            // use " " as the delimiter
        // if the match is found, update count variable
        // continue until end of file
    // do this for all three words, store values in three different int variables
    // print the words we were looking for, from most frequent to least
        // using a for loop and the int variables, print stars of histogram

// Main function
    // create three int variables of the words we're looking for to store the result from frequencyFinder function call
        // set the variable equal to the function call three times
    // function call to printHistogram

// frequencyFinder function
    // take in the word we are looking for
    // create file from path of input file "src/main/java/ex46/exercise46_input.txt"
    // use FileReader and BufferedReader to read info from file
    // create int variable count to keep track of how many times the word appears
    // while line is not null,
        // read in each word separated by a line
        // look for match
        // if the match is found using .equals, update count variable
        // continue until end of file
    // return count variable

// printHistogram function
    // take in ints of the words we're looking for: badger, mushroom, snake
    // compare to each other to find which occurs the most, middle, and least
        // print the name of the item when needed
        // call printStars function when needed

// printStars function
    // take in an int of the number of times a word appears
    // use a for loop and that int to print the * of the histogram
